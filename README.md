# RicardoCodeChallenge
Code Challenge for job position "Mobile Software Engineer"

iOS version tested on simulators : iPhone X, iPhone 8 plus and iPad Air 2
Android version tested on devices: LG G5 (LG-H850) and Samsung S5 (G900F)

Both coding was done in MVC pattern, since I know how to use MVVM binding with Xamarin Forms and those were not permitted.


Included: - Cross-platform project "Ricardo15" for VisualStudio 2015
	  - sql script for the database used as a model
